Demand Forecasting Problem
1. The attached support_requests.json file contains (simulated) timestamps of support requests for a company. Aggregate the data based on 15­minute time intervals, and visualize and describe the resulting time series of request counts in ways that best characterize the underlying patterns of the demand. 

Please report/illustrate important features of the demand, such as daily cycles. If there are data quality issues, please report them. 

2. Suppose you’re tasked with forecasting the demand for support services. Based on the insights you developed above, describe a method to forecast expected future demand at the same 15 ­minute granularity over the following hour (the 4 following time periods), at any given time. Apply your method to this dataset, and evaluate its predictive accuracy in a reasonable way. Discuss your method and its accuracy.

3. Not only are accurate mean predictions important, but so are appropriate characterizations of the stochastic nature of this demand. If not already done in part 2, describe a method to predict the probability distribution of demand in the following 15­ minute period. Describe how you would evaluate accuracy of these stochastic predictions. You don’t have to apply your method to the dataset.

Along with the final report (in pdf or docx), please attach your source code corresponding to problem statements (1) and (2).  Source code for (3) is optional.
